# What is Array Rotation?
It refers to the shifting of elements in an array either to left or to the right by some k elements. Suppose we are asked to make a right rotation of array A[8] by 3 elements
A[8] = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]

After right rotation,
A[8] = [6,7,8,1,2,3,4,5]

Now if we are asked to again a left rotation A[5] by 3 elements
Then after left rotation,
A[8]= [4,5,6,7,8,1,2,3]

## How to implement left rotation in arrays?
For implementing array left rotation, we can simply loop through the array and make array[i]=array[i+1]. This will shift the array to the left by one element. Now for a given value of k(k is the no. of elements by which the array has to be shifted towards left), we can repeat the above function k times to get the final array.

#### Code in C++
```cpp
int main()
{
    //performing left rotation on array A by k times
    int A[8] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
    int n = 8, k = 3, temp;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
    { //performing left rotation k times
        temp = A[0];
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) //left rotation of array by 1 element
            A[j] = A[j + 1];
        A[n - 1] = temp;
    }
    for (int x : A)
        cout << x << " "; //Output: 4 5 6 7 8 1 2 3
}
```

## How to find the element at the ith position after left rotating the array k times?
It’s super easy! 😄 All you have to do is print the array element at the given index.

#### Code in C++
```cpp
int main()
{
    //finding element at given position after performing left rotation on array A by k times
    int A[8] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
    int n = 8, k = 3, temp, index = 2;
    for (int i = 0; i < k; i++)
    { //performing left rotation k times
        temp = A[0];
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) //left rotation of array by 1 element
            A[j] = A[j + 1];
        A[n - 1] = temp;
    }
    cout << A[index]; // Output: 6 (Element at index 2 after rotation is 6)
}
```

#### Time Complexity: O(n*k)
#### Space Complexity: O(1)

## No. of rotations required to sort an array
An array whose elements are arranged in ascending order has been rotated to the left by k no. of elements. 
#### How would you find the number of rotations required to sort the array to its original form?🤓
Example: This is our original array A[8] = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8] and now it has been rotated to the left by some k no. of elements.
Modified array A[8]= [7,8,1,2,3,4,5,6]
We have to find no. of rotations needed to sort it.

The idea to solve it is simple, we can make a linear search to find if there is any element in our array whose next element is smaller than it. If such an element exists we will print the index+1, else we will print 0 indicating the array is sorted and no rotations are needed.
In this example, [7,8,1,2,3,4,5,6] we can observe that the element at index 2 is smaller than the element at index 1 and not following the ascending order.
So our output will be index+1 = 1+1 =2

#### Code in C++
```cpp
int main()
{
    //No. of rotations required to sort an array
    int A[8] = {7, 8, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
    int n = 8;
    for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++)
    {
        if (A[i + 1] < A[i])
        {
            cout << i + 1;
            return 0;
        }
    }
    cout << "0"; // Output: 2
    return 0;
}
```


You are done with the basics of Array Rotation! Happy Learning! ❤️
